                <div class="definition">
                    <p><strong>Factor V Leiden is a gene change that makes your blood clot more easily than usual.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <p>Your body naturally forms blood clots to stop bleeding when you're injured. Factor V (say "Factor Five") is a protein that helps blood clot.</p>

                <p>The Leiden mutation changes how this protein works. This means your blood may clot when it shouldn't.</p>

                <h3>How common is it?</h3>
                <p>About 5 out of every 100 people have this gene change. Many people don't know they have it until they're tested.</p>

                <div class="reassurance">
                    <p>✓ Having Factor V Leiden does not mean you will have problems during pregnancy. It just means we will watch you more closely.</p>

                <h2>Why It Matters in Pregnancy</h2>

                <p>Pregnancy naturally increases the risk of blood clots for all women. This is your body's way of preparing to prevent too much bleeding during delivery.</p>

                <h3>The combination effect</h3>
                <p>When you have Factor V Leiden AND you're pregnant, these two factors work together. This slightly increases your chance of developing a blood clot.</p>

                <div class="key-point">
                    <p><strong>Important to know:</strong> Most women with Factor V Leiden have healthy pregnancies and healthy babies. We monitor you carefully to keep both of you safe.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>What this means for your care</h3>
                <p>We will create a care plan designed just for you. This plan focuses on prevention and watching for any early signs of problems.</p>

                <h2>Possible Complications</h2>

                <p>Being informed helps you partner with us in your care. Here are the things we watch for:</p>

                <h3>Blood clots (thrombosis)</h3>
                <p>Blood clots can form in veins, usually in the legs. This is called deep vein thrombosis or DVT. Less commonly, a clot can travel to the lungs.</p>

                <h3>Pregnancy-related concerns</h3>
                <p>Some research suggests Factor V Leiden may be linked to pregnancy complications like preeclampsia or placental problems. The research is still unclear, but we monitor for these conditions.</p>

                <div class="important">
                    <p><strong>Remember:</strong> These are possible risks, not guaranteed outcomes. The vast majority of women with Factor V Leiden deliver healthy babies without these complications.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="reassurance">
                    <p>✓ We are watching closely for any signs of problems. Early detection allows us to take action quickly if needed.</p>

                <h3>Medication options</h3>
                <p>Based on your personal history and risk factors, we may recommend blood thinning medication. The most common choice is low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), which is safe during pregnancy.</p>

                <p><span class="highlight">How it works:</span> You give yourself a small injection under the skin once or twice daily. Most patients find this easier than expected.</p>

                <h3>Non-medication approaches</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Staying active and avoiding long periods of sitting</li>
                    <li>Wearing compression stockings if recommended</li>

                <h3>What to expect at visits</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blood pressure checks:</strong> We monitor for signs of preeclampsia</li>
                    <li><strong>Ultrasounds:</strong> Regular scans to check your baby's growth and the placenta</li>

                    <li><strong>Questions about symptoms:</strong> We want to hear about any changes you notice</li>

                <h3>How often will I be seen?</h3>
                <p>Your visit schedule depends on your individual risk. You may have more frequent appointments than a standard pregnancy. This extra attention is a good thing.</p>

                <h2>Delivery Planning</h2>

                <p>We start talking about delivery plans in your third trimester. Planning ahead reduces stress and ensures everyone is prepared.</p>

                <h3>Timing of delivery</h3>
                <p>Most women with Factor V Leiden can deliver at full term. We only consider early delivery if there are specific medical concerns.</p>

                <h3>Mode of delivery</h3>
                <p>Having Factor V Leiden alone does not mean you need a cesarean section. You can plan for vaginal delivery unless there are other medical reasons for a C-section.</p>

                <h3>Coordinating your care</h3>
                <p>We work with your delivery team to ensure they know about your condition. If you're on blood thinning medication, we'll plan when to stop it before delivery.</p>

                <div class="important">
                    <p><strong>Anesthesia planning:</strong> If you want an epidural for pain relief, we time the stopping of blood thinners to make this safe. We discuss this plan with you well before delivery.</p>

                <h2>Labor and Delivery Precautions</h2>

                <h3>Managing blood thinners</h3>
                <p>If you're taking medication to prevent clots, we typically stop it 24 hours before a scheduled delivery. For unplanned labor, we assess the timing and plan accordingly.</p>

                <h3>Pain management options</h3>
                <p>You have options for pain relief. Epidurals are usually safe, but timing matters if you're on blood thinners. We work with the anesthesia team to keep you safe and comfortable.</p>

                <h3>After delivery</h3>
                <p>We monitor you closely in the hours after birth. This is when the risk of bleeding and clotting both need careful attention.</p>

                <p>The weeks after delivery are actually the highest risk time for blood clots. This is true for all new mothers, and especially for those with Factor V Leiden.</p>

                <h3>Medication after delivery</h3>
                <p>We typically restart blood thinning medication within 12-24 hours after delivery. You'll continue this for at least 6 weeks postpartum.</p>

                <p><span class="highlight">Breastfeeding:</span> Blood thinning medications like heparin are safe while breastfeeding. They don't pass into breast milk in significant amounts.</p>

                <h3>Activity and movement</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Get up and walk as soon as you're able after delivery</li>

                    <p>✓ Yes! Most women with Factor V Leiden have successful, healthy pregnancies.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>What "normal" looks like with Factor V Leiden</h3>
                <p>You'll have more medical appointments than some pregnant women. You might need to take medication daily. But you can still:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Work during pregnancy (unless you have other medical restrictions)</li>
                    <li>Exercise with your doctor's approval</li>
                    <li>Travel with planning and precautions</li>
                    <li>Enjoy your pregnancy and prepare for your baby</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The difference is awareness</h3>
                <p>You know about your condition, which means we can take steps to keep you safe. Many people with Factor V Leiden don't know they have it until a problem occurs. You have the advantage of prevention.</p>

                <div class="key-point">
                    <p><strong>Your role matters:</strong> Taking medication as prescribed, attending appointments, and reporting symptoms quickly all contribute to a healthy outcome.</p>

                <h2>What About My Family?</h2>

                <h3>Is Factor V Leiden genetic?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Factor V Leiden is inherited, meaning it runs in families.</p>

                <p>If you have Factor V Leiden, each of your children has a 50% chance of inheriting it. Your siblings and parents may also have it.</p>

                <h3>Should my family be tested?</h3>
                <p>We don't routinely recommend testing family members unless they have symptoms or specific risk factors. Talk to your doctor about whether testing makes sense for your family.</p>

                <h3>What about my baby?</h3>
                <p>Even if your baby inherits Factor V Leiden, most children with this gene change have no problems. It typically doesn't cause issues until adulthood, if at all.</p>

                <div class="reassurance">
                    <p>✓ Knowing you have Factor V Leiden helps us make informed decisions for your health and potentially helps your family members too.</p>
