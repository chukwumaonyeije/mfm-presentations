            <p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 30px;">This guide explains why you're receiving specialized care and what to expect during your pregnancy.</p>
            <div class="good-news">
                <strong>Good News:</strong> Your current ultrasound shows your baby is growing well and your cervix is healthy.

        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Advanced Maternal Age</h1>
            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p><span class="term">Advanced maternal age</span> means being 35 years or older when pregnant.</p>
            <p>This is a medical term, not a judgment about your health or ability to have a healthy pregnancy.</p>
            
            <h2>Why does it matter?</h2>
            <p>Women 35 and older have slightly higher chances of certain pregnancy complications.</p>
            <p>Your doctor watches more closely for things like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>High blood pressure</li>
                <li>Gestational diabetes</li>
                <li>Chromosome differences in the baby</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="good-news">
                <strong>Important:</strong> Most women over 35 have completely healthy pregnancies and babies.

        <!-- Slide 3: History of Preterm Delivery -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>History of Preterm Delivery</h1>
            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p><span class="term">Preterm delivery</span> means having a baby before 37 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
            <p>In your previous pregnancy, you delivered at 36 weeks after your water broke early.</p>
            
            <h2>Why does it matter?</h2>
            <p>Having one preterm delivery increases the chance of it happening again.</p>
            <p>However, many women who had one preterm delivery go on to have full-term pregnancies.</p>
            
            <h2>What we're watching for:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Changes in your cervix (the opening to the uterus)</li>
                <li>Signs of early labor</li>
                <li>Your water breaking early</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- Slide 4: Your Current Status -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Your Pregnancy Today</h1>
            <h2>What we found at your ultrasound:</h2>
            
            <div class="good-news">
                <p><strong>✓ Cervical length: 4.71 cm</strong> - This is completely normal and healthy</p>
                <p><strong>✓ Baby's weight: 1 pound 2 ounces</strong> - Growing right on track (38th percentile)</p>
                <p><strong>✓ Amniotic fluid: Normal amount</strong></p>
                <p><strong>✓ Baby's heart rate: 140 beats per minute</strong> - Healthy and strong</p>
                <p><strong>✓ No structural problems detected</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <h2>What this means:</h2>
            <p>Your cervix is staying closed and firm.</p>
            <p>There are no signs of early labor or problems with this pregnancy right now.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Bottom line:</strong> While you're labeled "high-risk," you're actually on the lower end of that category. Things look good.

        <!-- Slide 5: About Your Cramping -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h1>Understanding Your Cramping</h1>
            <h2>What you experienced:</h2>
            <p>You've had two episodes of cramping after being active (walking, grocery shopping).</p>
            <p>Both times, the cramping stopped after you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Went to the bathroom</li>
                <li>Drank water</li>
                <li>Rested and lay down</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>What this means:</h2>
            <p>These symptoms are common and normal in pregnancy.</p>
            <p>Your uterus is growing and sometimes tightens (contracts) after activity.</p>
            <p>Since your cervix is normal and the cramping stops with rest, this is not a sign of preterm labor.</p>
            
            <div class="good-news">
                <strong>Reassuring signs:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>No vaginal bleeding</li>
                    <li>Cramping stops with rest</li>
                    <li>Normal cervical length</li>

                <li>Continue your regular prenatal appointments with your obstetrician</li>
                <li>Keep taking your medications (prenatal vitamins, vitamin B6, Zoloft, citalopram)</li>
