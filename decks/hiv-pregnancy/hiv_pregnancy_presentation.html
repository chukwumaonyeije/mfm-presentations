            <p class="subtitle">A Guide for You and Your Baby</p>
            
            <p>Welcome. This presentation will help you understand HIV during pregnancy.</p>
            
            <p>You are not alone. We are your partners in care.</p>
            
            <div class="success-box">
                <p><strong>Good news:</strong> With today's medical care, more than 99% of babies born to mothers with HIV are born HIV-free.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>This presentation will answer your questions about:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What HIV means for your pregnancy</li>
                <li>How we protect your baby</li>
                <li>What medications you'll take</li>
                <li>What to expect during delivery</li>
                <li>How to care for your baby after birth</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 2: What is HIV? -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>What is HIV?</h2>
            
            <div class="definition">
                <p><strong>HIV</strong> stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. It is a virus that affects your immune system.</p>
                <p><strong>Your immune system</strong> is your body's defense against infections.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>How HIV Works</h3>
            <p>HIV enters certain cells in your body. Over time, without treatment, it can weaken your immune system.</p>
            
            <p>With treatment, HIV becomes a manageable chronic condition. This means you can live a long, healthy life.</p>
            
            <h3>HIV and AIDS: What's the Difference?</h3>
            <p><strong>HIV</strong> is the virus itself.</p>
            <p><strong>AIDS</strong> is a condition that can develop if HIV goes untreated for many years.</p>
            
            <div class="success-box">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> With proper treatment, HIV does not progress to AIDS. Most people with HIV who take their medications never develop AIDS.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 3: HIV During Pregnancy - What It Means -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>What Does HIV Mean for My Pregnancy?</h2>
            
            <p>Finding out you have HIV during pregnancy can feel overwhelming. Many emotions are normal.</p>
            
            <p>Here's what you need to know:</p>
            
            <div class="success-box">
                <p><strong>You can have a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby.</strong></p>
                <p>Thousands of women with HIV have healthy pregnancies every year.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Your Pregnancy Care</h3>
            <p>You will have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Regular prenatal visits (like all pregnant women)</li>
                <li>Additional blood tests to monitor your health</li>
                <li>Medications to protect you and your baby</li>
                <li>A specialized care team working with you</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Your Baby</h3>
            <p>Without treatment, HIV can pass from mother to baby during pregnancy, labor, or breastfeeding.</p>
            
            <p><strong>With treatment, the chance of passing HIV to your baby is less than 1%.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 4: How We Prevent Transmission -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>How We Protect Your Baby</h2>
            
            <p>We use a combination of proven strategies to keep your baby safe.</p>
            
            <h3>The Three-Part Protection Plan</h3>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>1. Your Medications During Pregnancy</strong></p>
                <p>You take HIV medications every day. These medications lower the amount of virus in your blood to very low or undetectable levels.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>2. Delivery Planning</strong></p>
                <p>We plan the safest delivery method based on your viral load (amount of virus in your blood).</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>3. Baby's Medications After Birth</strong></p>
                <p>Your baby receives HIV medication for 4-6 weeks after birth as an extra layer of protection.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="success-box">
                <p class="stat">&lt;1%</p>
                <p><strong>When all three steps are followed, fewer than 1 in 100 babies will get HIV from their mother.</strong></p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 5: Medications During Pregnancy -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Your Medications During Pregnancy</h2>
            
            <h3>What Medications Will I Take?</h3>
            <p>You will take a combination of HIV medications called antiretroviral therapy (ART).</p>
            
            <div class="definition">
                <p><strong>Antiretroviral therapy (ART):</strong> A combination of medications that stop HIV from multiplying in your body.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Most people take 1-3 pills per day. Your doctor will choose medications that are safe during pregnancy.</p>
            
            <h3>Why Are These Medications Important?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>They protect your health</li>
                <li>They lower the virus in your blood to undetectable levels</li>
                <li>They protect your baby from getting HIV</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Undetectable = Untransmittable</strong></p>
                <p>When your viral load is undetectable, you cannot transmit HIV to your baby during pregnancy.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Are These Medications Safe for My Baby?</h3>
            <p>Yes. The medications we use during pregnancy have been studied extensively.</p>
            <p>The benefits of taking these medications far outweigh any risks.</p>
            <p>Not taking medication would put your baby at much higher risk of getting HIV.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 6: Taking Your Medications -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>What Can I Do? Taking Your Medications</h2>
            
            <p>Taking your medications every day is the most important thing you can do to protect your baby.</p>
            
            <h3>Tips for Success</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Set a daily alarm</strong> on your phone for the same time each day</li>
                <li><strong>Keep medications visible</strong> where you'll see them (like next to your toothbrush)</li>
                <li><strong>Use a pill organizer</strong> to track your daily doses</li>
                <li><strong>Tell someone you trust</strong> who can help remind you</li>
                <li><strong>Link medication time to a daily routine</strong> (like breakfast or bedtime)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What If I Miss a Dose?</h3>
            <p>Take it as soon as you remember. Then take your next dose at the regular time.</p>
            <p>Don't double up on doses.</p>
            <p>Tell your doctor if you miss doses often. We can help you find solutions.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Side Effects?</strong></p>
                <p>Some people have mild side effects at first (like nausea or headache). These usually improve within a few weeks.</p>
                <p>Never stop taking your medications without talking to your doctor first. We can adjust your medications if needed.</p>

        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Your Prenatal Care and Monitoring</h2>
            
            <h3>What Happens Next?</h3>
            <p>You will have regular prenatal visits throughout your pregnancy.</p>
            
            <h3>Your Care Team</h3>
            <p>Your team may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist:</strong> A doctor who specializes in high-risk pregnancies</li>
                <li><strong>Infectious disease specialist:</strong> A doctor who specializes in HIV care</li>
                <li><strong>Your regular OB/GYN</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Nurses, social workers, and pharmacists</strong></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Tests You'll Have</h3>
            <p><strong>Viral load tests:</strong> Measure the amount of HIV in your blood. Done every 4-12 weeks.</p>
            <p><strong>CD4 count:</strong> Measures your immune system strength. Done every 3-6 months.</p>
            <p><strong>Regular pregnancy ultrasounds:</strong> To check your baby's growth and development.</p>
            
            <div class="success-box">
                <p><strong>Our Goal:</strong> Get your viral load to undetectable levels before delivery. This gives your baby the best protection.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 8: Labor and Delivery -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Planning for Labor and Delivery</h2>
            
            <h3>What Happens Next?</h3>
            <p>Your delivery plan depends on your viral load near the end of pregnancy.</p>
            
            <h3>If Your Viral Load is Undetectable</h3>
            <p>You can plan for a vaginal delivery if you and your baby are healthy.</p>
            <p>You will receive IV medications during labor for extra protection.</p>
            
            <h3>If Your Viral Load is Detectable</h3>
            <p>If your viral load is above 1,000 copies/mL near delivery, we recommend a planned cesarean section (C-section).</p>
            
            <div class="definition">
                <p><strong>Cesarean section (C-section):</strong> A surgical delivery where your baby is born through an incision in your abdomen. This reduces contact with blood and fluids during birth.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>A C-section is usually scheduled at 38 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>During Any Delivery:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You'll continue your HIV medications</li>
                    <li>We avoid procedures that could increase transmission risk</li>
                    <li>Your baby will be gently cleaned right after birth</li>
                    <li>Your baby will start HIV medication within 12 hours</li>

        <!-- Slide 9: After Baby is Born -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>After Your Baby is Born</h2>
            
            <h3>Your Baby's Medications</h3>
            <p>Your baby will receive HIV medication (usually a liquid form) for 4-6 weeks.</p>
            <p>The exact length depends on your viral load during pregnancy.</p>
            
            <p>This medication is very safe for babies. It provides extra protection during the first weeks of life.</p>
            
            <h3>Testing Your Baby</h3>
            <p>Your baby will be tested for HIV several times:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>At birth or within 48 hours</strong></li>
                <li><strong>At 1-2 months</strong></li>
                <li><strong>At 4-6 months</strong></li>

            <p>These are special tests that can detect HIV very early in babies.</p>
            
            <div class="success-box">
                <p><strong>Most babies test negative at all time points.</strong></p>

            <h3>Breastfeeding and HIV</h3>
            <p>HIV can be transmitted through breast milk.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>In the United States, we recommend formula feeding for babies born to mothers with HIV.</strong></p>
            </div>
            
            <p>This recommendation is based on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Safe, affordable formula is available</li>
                <li>Formula feeding eliminates the risk of HIV transmission through breast milk</li>
                <li>Even with an undetectable viral load, there is still a small risk with breastfeeding</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What Can I Do?</h3>
            <p>Formula feeding allows you to bond with your baby safely.</p>
            
            <p>Ways to bond while bottle feeding:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hold your baby close during feedings</li>
                <li>Make eye contact and talk or sing</li>
                <li>Skin-to-skin contact before or after feeding</li>
                <li>Let your partner and family members feed the baby too</li>
